## How to Download and Use:
You can either build the Jar locally by calling `mvn package -DskipTests` from the parent directory, or you can download it from the Eclipse Repositories:
 - [Release Repository](https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/paho-releases/org/eclipse/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.utility/)

Once you have the Jar, run it by executing: `java -jar org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.utility-1.1.1.jar` substituting the correct filename depending on the version.
