/**
 * Enables an application to communicate with an MQTT server using non-blocking methods.
 * <p>
 * It provides applications a simple programming interface to all features of the MQTT version 5
 * specification including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>connect
 * <li>publish
 * <li>subscribe
 * <li>unsubscribe
 * <li>disconnect
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are two styles of MQTT client, this one and {@link IMqttClient}.</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>IMqttAsyncClient provides a set of non-blocking methods that return control to the
 * invoking application after initial validation of parameters and state. The main processing is
 * performed in the background so as not to block the application program's thread. This non-
 * blocking approach is handy when the application needs to carry on processing while the
 * MQTT action takes place. For instance connecting to an MQTT server can take time, using
 * the non-blocking connect method allows an application to display a busy indicator while the
 * connect action takes place in the background. Non blocking methods are particularly useful
 * in event oriented programs and graphical programs where invoking methods that take time
 * to complete on the the main or GUI thread can cause problems. The non-blocking interface
 * can also be used in blocking form.</li>
 * <li>IMqttClient provides a set of methods that block and return control to the application
 * program once the MQTT action has completed. It is a thin layer that sits on top of the
 * IMqttAsyncClient implementation and is provided mainly for compatibility with earlier
 * versions of the MQTT client. In most circumstances it is recommended to use IMqttAsyncClient
 * based clients which allow an application to mix both non-blocking and blocking calls. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An application is not restricted to using one style if an IMqttAsyncClient based client is used
 * as both blocking and non-blocking methods can be used in the same application. If an IMqttClient
 * based client is used then only blocking methods are available to the application.
 * For more details on the blocking client see {@link IMqttClient}</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two forms of non-blocking method:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     <p>In this form a callback is registered with the promise. The callback will be
 *     notified when the action succeeds or fails. The callback is invoked on the thread
 *     managed by the MQTT client so it is important that processing is minimised in the
 *     callback. If not the operation of the MQTT client will be inhibited. For example
 *     to be notified (called back) when a connect completes:</p>
 *     <pre>
 *     	IMqttToken conToken;
 *	    conToken = asyncClient.connect()
 *          .then(p -&gt; {
 *                  log("Connected");
 *                  return p;
 *              }, p -&gt; {
 *                  log ("connect failed" + exception);
 *              });
 *      </pre>
 *	    <p>An optional context object can be passed into the method which will then be made
 *      available in the callback. The context is stored by the MQTT client in the token
 *      which is then returned to the invoker. The context is also provided to the callback methods
 *      where the context can then be accessed.
 *     </p>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     <pre>
 *     IMqttToken token = asyncClient.method(parms)
 *     </pre>
 *     <p>In this form the method returns a token that can be used to track the
 *     progress of the action (method). The method provides a getPromise()
 *     method that represents the state of the action. Once the action is
 *     completed the getValue() method on the promise can be used to get the
 *     result, but more normally one of the Promise's callback methods will
 *     be used to find out if the action completed successfully or not. For example:
 * 	   </p>
 *     <pre>
 *      IMqttToken conToken;
 *   	conToken = asyncClient.client.connect(conToken);
 *     ... do some work...
 *   	conToken.getValue();
 *     </pre>
 *   </li>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <pre>
 *     IMqttToken token method(parms, Object userContext, IMqttActionListener callback)
 *     </pre>
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 *   <p>To understand when the delivery of a message is complete either of the two methods above
 *   can be used to either wait on or be notified when the publish completes.</p>
 *

	 * 	<li>A leading "/" creates a distinct topic.  For example, <em>/finance</em> is
	 * 	different from <em>finance</em>. <em>/finance</em> matches "+/+" and "/+", but

	 *  can represent zero or more levels. Therefore, <em>finance/#</em> can also match
	 * 	the singular <em>finance</em>, where <em>#</em> represents zero levels. The topic
	 * 	level separator is meaningless in this context, because there are no levels
	 * 	to separate.</p>
	 *
	 * 	<p>The <span>multi-level</span> wildcard can
	 * 	be specified only on its own or next to the topic level separator character.
	 * 	Therefore, <em>#</em> and <em>finance/#</em> are both valid, but <em>finance#</em> is
	 * 	not valid. <span>The multi-level wildcard must be the last character
	 *  used within the topic tree. For example, <em>finance/#</em> is valid but
	 *  <em>finance/#/closingprice</em> is 	not valid.</span></p></dd>
	 *
	 * 	<dt>Single-level wildcard</dt>
	 * 	<dd><p>The plus sign (+) is a wildcard character that matches only one topic
	 * 	level. For example, <em>finance/stock/+</em> matches
	 * <em>finance/stock/ibm</em> and <em>finance/stock/xyz</em>,
	 * 	but not <em>finance/stock/ibm/closingprice</em>. Also, because the single-level
	 * 	wildcard matches only a single level, <em>finance/+</em> does not match <em>finance</em>.</p>
	 *
	 * 	<p>Use
	 * 	the single-level wildcard at any level in the topic tree, and in conjunction
	 * 	with the multilevel wildcard. Specify the single-level wildcard next to the
	 * 	topic level separator, except when it is specified on its own. Therefore,
	 *  <em>+</em> and <em>finance/+</em> are both valid, but <em>finance+</em> is
	 *  not valid. <span>The single-level wildcard can be used at the end of the
	 *  topic tree or within the topic tree.
	 * 	For example, <em>finance/+</em> and <em>finance/+/ibm</em> are both valid.</span></p>
